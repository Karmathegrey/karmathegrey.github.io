            <b><i>Karma isn't magic - it's math.</b></i> Every action leaves a trace.. Every exploit echoes back..  
            Intentions matter.. You may walk the edge, but ultimately.. Every decision, every action..  
            Leads you down a path.. These lead to tough choices.. Right or wrong.. You'll face consequences..  
            That will define who you are.. Stay sharp, move smart, be the change you want to see in the world..  
            The universe is watching.. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Karma will find you..
